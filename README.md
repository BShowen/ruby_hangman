# Hangman style serialization in Ruby

This is a project about serialization within Ruby. I have created a hangman style game where you have to guess a word that was selected by the computer. However the point of the game is to demonstrate serialization, or my knowledge of serialization so far, within Ruby. 

At anypoint in the game you can save your game state to a file on your computer. You can then completely close out the game and wait a few minutes, months, years, decades, centuries, eons or whatever you want, and then come back and load it right back up where you left off. 

##### I am following the curriculum over at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). I have alot of appreciation for the folks who run The Odin Project and for everyone who has helped me along the way so far. Consider dropping by even if only to say hi in the chatroom. Thanks for checking this out.
